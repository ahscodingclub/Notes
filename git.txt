**How to use git**
git status -> make sure that git is installed and functional 
git remote -v -> show verbose information on the remote
git config --global user.name "ahscodingclub" -> set your username
git config --global user.email "jake.sauter3@gmail.com" -> set your email
*there is two options for starting a repository 
  git clone https://github.com/ahscodingclub/Notes.git -> clone a repository to your directory 
  git init -> make your directory a git repository
git status
git diff <filename> -- shows the differences of the file that have been tracked     
                        versus the current version of the file
    git remote add origin <https//...> -> add a repository thats made using init locally
    git push -u origin master 
git add <filename> -> add a file to be tracked in your repository
git add . -> adds all the changed to be committed
git commit -a -m '<comment>' -> make a commit
git push origin <remote> master <branch> -> push changed from the clone to the master branch
git reset --soft HEAD^ -> remove the last commit but keep the changes to the file
git reset --hard HEAD^ -> this line removes the last commit and reverts the changes to the file
git checkout -b myBranch -> create and move to that new branch
**to use git pages, make the master branch named
"gh-pages" then settings->default branch-> gh-pages and delete the master branch
--
git rm <filename> -- to untrack and remove a file from a git repository
