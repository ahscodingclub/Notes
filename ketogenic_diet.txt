****Nueuroscientific effects of ketons on brain function****
* ketones help with the production of glutamate which get
  made into gaba, however it also seems to increase the ratio
  of production from glutamate to gaba 
* ketones have less steps to become atp (energy for muscles)
* levels of glucose can never be 0, they help with some neuro-
  transmitters
****Physiological effects of ketons****
* noticible increase in breathe hold time
* through fasting the brain will naturally
  start to rely on ketons through the consumpion
  of fat reserves. 
**tracking diets**
* keep track of macros
    macros: <cals> <fat>f/<cholestoral>c/<protein>p
**Ketogenic diet**
* no rice, bread, fruits and some vegetables
* diet based on fat and protein 
*example diet: 
  * breakfast - eggs, spinach, mushrooms, peppers, cheese is not that bad, 
  * lunch - cashew chicken salad, more cashews on side 
  * dinner - something fatty, (salmon, lamb) with vegitables (asparagus/brocolli)
****Vegetarian****
* keep carbs below 20-30 grams per day 
* keep pescatarianism a possibility
* eggs, cheeses, seeds, nuts, green leafy vegitables
* 60-80% of caleries come from high-quality fats
* fats - butter, cream, cocunut oil, cocunut milk,
  nuts, cheese
* protein .5 grams protenin per pound 
* mct oil will help liver produce ketones
* once in ketosis, the body will stay in ketosis 
  if it isgetting less than 100g of carbs per day 
* tofu, greek yogurt are good options
** Ketoacidosis is not a risk due to insulin still 
   being present, however is a possible problem for
   diabetics
* other risks and solutions
   * fatigue - b5 
   * cramps - potassium
   * bloating - bile salsts (bhb)
   * sleep issues - calcium / magnesium
* very little sugar can be consumed to allow the body
  to switch over to a ketogenic state
