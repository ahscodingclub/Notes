Cognition: a term referring to the mental processes involved in gaining knowledge and comprehension, 
            including thinking, knowing, remembering, judging and problem solving. These are higher 
            level function of the brain and encompass language, imagination, perception and planning.
            (and even emotion). 

Cognitive science is an interdisciplinary endeavor that aims to understand cognition

What are the (historically speaking) the disciplines that contribute to Cognitive Science?:

Psychology

Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence)

Philosophy

Linguistics

Question raised: Is there a language of thought
  linguistic nativism-- language is innate to mind
  linguistic empericisism -- language is learned 

***8/30/2017***

Increasingly, the following fields are making contributions to (as well as being by)
Cognitive Science

"Learning Sciences"(Education)

Biology (particularly evolutionary biology and ecology)

Literary and historical studies ("Cognitive Humanities")

Art and music

Sociology and Business

Cognitive Science has practical, as well as theoretical aims

** Cognitive Science: Some Early Prehistory 
(Important note -- this "story" is told from a Eurocentric perspective!)

An important area: epistemology, or theory of knowledge

The Greek Philosiphers: Plato and Aristotle

Painting: The School of Athens by Rafael 

Socrates --> Plato --> Aristotle 

Plato emphasized the realm of the forms 

Aristotle was more scientific

HW: flatland 

Dualism: The Contribution of Descartes

Descartes -- Interseted in the connection between mind and body; Methodological doubt; the ontological argument; 
             contributions to analytic philosipy; cartesien coordinate system 

Dualism: There are two distinct kinds of substances: mental and physical 

questions: are they really distinct?; If they are not distinct, what is the relationship

***9/1/2017***

Associationism: is the idea that mental processes operate by the conjunction 
(or "association") of one state with its successor states.

John Locke, David Hume, James Mill, John Stuart Mill were philosiphers who
advocated this view

The study of mind remained solely in the province of philosophy until the nineteenth 
century, when experimental psychology developed.

Wilhelm Wundt and his students initiated laboratory methods for studying mental 
operations more systematically.

*Some intellectual precursores to contemporary Cognitive Science
1) The reaction against Behaviorism in Psycology 

Behaviorism, the doctrine, is committed in its fullest and most complete
sense to the truth of the following three sets of claims.

1. Psychology is the science of behavior. 
   Psychology is not the science of mind. 

2. Behavior can be described and explained without making ultimate
reference to mental events or to internal psychological processes.

The sources of behavior are external (in the environment), not internal
(in the head).

In science, it is important to answer the question: 
  What are the boundary conditions

Recommended book: John Holland Signals and Boundaries

3. In the course of theory development in psychology, if, somehow, mental terms 
or concepts are deployed in describing or explaining behavior, then either (a) these
terms or concepts should be eliminated and replaced by behavioral terms or (b) the can
and should be translated or paraphrased into behavioral concepts.

Some major figures in modern behaviorist movement:

Ivan Pavolov (early 20th century): nobel prize for classical conditional

John watson (early 20th century): Hopkins

B.F. Skinner (mid 20th century): Professor at Harvard, wrote Walden 2

Henry David Through wrote Walden 

*Some aspects of Behaviorism: 

Classical Conditioning

Classical conditioning happends when a stimulus the animal can identify
(such as an odor in the water) is followed by a bioloically significant
event (such as the appearance of food).

After several such pairings, the animal learns the connection.

The next time the stimulus occurs, the animal acts like it expects the 
same event. That is, it makes the anticipatory response.

Putting them together: 3 case studies

Terry Winograd and SHRDLU

The imagery debate

Matt’s theory of vision

Background to SHRDLU

Idea of language as: 
Hierarchically organized
Planned
Rule-goverened

2) Computational approach to information-processing

SHRDLU is a program for understanding natural language, writeen by Terry Winograd at the M.I.T. Artificial Intelligence Labratory in 1968-70.  SHRDLU carried on a simple dialog (via teltype) with a user, about a small world of objects ( the BLOCKS world) shown on an early display screen)

What is a simulation

In what cases does a simulation represent what we might consider reality?

Direct analogy between formal languages and natural languages

Hierarchical organization                                    Recursion
Plan                                            Programs
Rules                                            Agorithms

Context-free grammars → transformation or production rules

***9/25/2017***

Common assumptions about information:

Information is coded in a digital/propositional format
based on the formal languages used to program computers

Digital information-coding

Information is coded in a format that has the basic properties
of a language: 

Basic constituents are individual symbols

A constituent is a part of a whole

Compositionality --> complex structures are built up 
from idividual symbols according to formation rules

Arbitrary connections between symbolic structures
and what they represent

Digital information-processing

The model for thinking about digital
information-processing are formal languages
(e.g. logical languages and computer programming 
languages)

Model information-processing on, e.g. 

proofs in logical languages

implementatoin of insturctions in a production system

Imagistic informating-coding

Non-symbolic: images are not built up from basic elements

Not compositional

The parts of image cannot reoccur in other images

No rules for buidling up images from their parts


***9/27/2017***
Representation in images

Representation depends upon systematic correlation between properties of
representation and properties of what it represents

  pictoral depiction depends upon resemblance

  can be schematic resemblance, as in a map

The issues for cognitive science

Is information always encoded in a digital format - or are three
cases of imagistically encoded information?

How can we explore this experimentally?

By looking at how subjects carry out information-processing 
tasks involving images

Seeing whether their behavior provides indirect evidence
that they are scanning/manipulating images

dates back to wilhelm wundt

the strong interpretation

Subjects perform the task by rotation/scanning
mental images in their "mind's eye"

Te preocess of mental reotation/scanning has is structurally
similar to physical processes of rotation/scanning

Seems to match evidence from introspection

Problems with the strong interpretation

Dennett's "Cartesian theatre"

Who or what is doing the scanning/rotating?

  Where is the image projected?

  Threat of regress if we take the 
  metaphor of the "mind's eye" literally

Three milestones

1) SHRDLUE - WINOGRAD
2) IMAGERY DEBATE (DIGITAL/IMAGISTIC)
3) DAVID MARRS THREE PRINCIPLES

Marr's approach to vision

Distinguished different explanatory tasks at different levels

Gave a general theoretical framework from combining thme

apply the framework in considerable detail to a single example ; the early visual system in animals.

Marr's three level 

Computational -- What is the task being studies

Algorithmic -- how can the task be modeled in terms of preocsses

Implementational -- how can the process be made to run in a machine or some 
other mechanism (like a body)

Identifications (key concepts and people) 8C5 

What is cognitive science?

  Is there such a thing as cognitive science (as opposed to the cognitive sciences)?

  Are there any basic assumptions about the mind that unify all the different
  models and approaches we have been considering?

  Does cognitive science have a distinctive methodology?

what is the difference between an area of knowledge and a discipline

tacit

DISCIPLINARY HEXAGRAM (COULD BE ON TEST)

Identifies connections between different cognitive sciences, but sheds no light
on why there need to be suc connections

Doesnt help us to understand what each discipline contributes

Desn't give a very accurate picture of contemporary cognitive science.

Basic assumptions

The mind is too complicated to be understood using the resources
of any discipline on its own

Need for interdisciplinarity

  The mind has to be undersstood at many different levels

Unification of knowledge perspective -- a kind of ideal → reductionism → trying to find a fundamental principle (or intellectual “field”) → Auguste Comte

An example of reductionism:  Social Sciences → interaction of groups → Biology (explained in terms of biology?) → Chemistry → interaction of chemical elements → Physics (Explained in terms of particles and physical properties)
