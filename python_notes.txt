** from __future__ import division

	An example is

	from __future__ import division
	print 8/7  # prints 1.1428571428571428
	print 8//7 # prints 1

	Without the __future__ stuff, both print statements would print 1.

	The internal difference is that without that import, / is mapped to the __div__() method, while 
	with it, __truediv__() is used. (In any case, // calls __floordiv__().)

	A future statement is a directive to the compiler that a particular module should be compiled 
	using syntax or semantics that will be available in a specified future release of Python. The 
	future statement is intended to ease migration to future versions of Python that introduce 
	incompatible changes to the language. It allows use of the new features on a per-module basis 
	before the release in which the feature becomes standard.
