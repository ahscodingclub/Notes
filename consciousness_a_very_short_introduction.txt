* qualia - indescribable qualities ( quale in singular context )
* Rene Descartes ( French philosipher) ( 1596-1650 ) formatlly proposed Cartesian dualism, 
    or the thought that the mind and brain are seperate. He then went on to propose that 
    the meet between these two seperate worlds is in the pineal gland.However this is a 
    flawed proposition because then an object in the physical realm would be linking the two realms.
* monoists combat this idea, but in different ways. 
    idealist - mind is fundamental and try to describe the physical world. 
    neutralist - the mental and the physical are two ways of organizing or describing 
      the same elements, which are themselves "neutral", that is, neither physical 
      nor mental, denies that the mental and the physical are two fundamentally different things.
    materialist - matter is fundamental, but must describe how conciousness arises ( me )  
* David Chalmers ( Australian philosipher) coined the 'hard problem' in 1994
* The Hard Problem - How can a physical brain, made purely of substances give rise to these ineffable qualia?
* he also mentions 'easy problems' which include explaining memory and learning.
* his ideas can be refuted because we cannot know what problems are easy or hard before we
  solve them, and his theory is based on when we solve all of these easy problems, that there
  will be something left out.
* phenomenal consciousness - what its like to be in a certain state.
* access conciousness - availability for use in thinking.
